# Robot Shortest Path Finder  

## Overview  
This project is implemented using **Java** to determine the shortest path between a start and end point for a robot. It utilizes **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** along with **Queue** and **Linked List** data structures to efficiently compute the shortest path.  

## Features  
- **Finds the shortest path** using the BFS algorithm  
- **Allows users to select the start and end points**  
- **Supports customizable grid size**  
- **Uses a Queue for traversal** and a **Linked List to store paths**  
- **Ideal for grid-based pathfinding without weights**  
- **Handles obstacle avoidance**  

## Technologies Used  
- **Java**  
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Algorithm**  
- **Queue and Linked List Data Structures**
